## 🎯 Note About Cursor & VS Code Marketplace

Cursor uses the **exact same marketplace** as VS Code. Any extension published to the VS Code Marketplace is automatically available in Cursor. There's no separate submission needed!

If you're not seeing it immediately, it's just a cache/indexing delay. The methods above will work right away!

Enjoy your Diff Checker! 🎉
